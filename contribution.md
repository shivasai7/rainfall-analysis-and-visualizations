# Welcome to contributors
    We hope you are contributing to something that you need or will be using. We'd encourage you to take a backlog and see if any of our GitHub issues capture your requirement. 
If you're planning to implement a more complex feature, it would be helpful to submit a draft PR with minimal implementation to discuss your approach first. It would also be 
helpful to include your use case so that we can understand your requirements better. This is to make sure the intended implementation would align with our architecture and 
direction.
    When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making 
a change.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:PYTHON 3

MODULES  USED:

* PANDAS:

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* GEOPANDAS:

GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier.It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in 
pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely.

 * NUMPY:

NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

* MATPLOTLIB:

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.Matplotlib has support for visualizing information with a wide 
array of colors and colormaps.

* PLOTLY:

plotly.py is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python ✨ Built on top of plotly.js, plotly.py is a high-level, declarative charting library. ... 
Plotly graphs can be viewed in Jupyter notebooks, standalone HTML files, or hosted online on plot.ly.

* Seaborn:
 
It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

* NOMINATIM:

Nominatim is a search engine for OpenStreetMap data. This is the debugging interface. You may search for a name or address (forward search) or look up data by its geographic 
coordinate (reverse search). Each result comes with a link to a details page where you can inspect what data about the object is saved in the database and investigate how the 
address of the object has been computed.

* CUFFLINKS:

Cufflinks, a library for easy interactive Pandas charting with Plotly. Cufflinks binds Plotly directly to pandas dataframes.

# Code of Conduct
    Open Source has always been a foundation of the Internet, and with the advent of social open source networks this is more true than ever. But free, libre, and open source 
projects suffer from a startling lack of diversity, with dramatically low representation by people of color, and other marginalized populations. Often it is the unintentional 
assumptions and actions of project maintainers and participants that make open source projects nwelcoming (or even hostile) to marginalized people: making assumptions about 
inappropriate language, or demonstrating a lack of regard for the safety and well-being of vulnerable people.

# Bug report and template
    Lets assume in your application under test you want to create a new user with user information, for that you need to login into the application and navigate to USERS menu 
    > New User, then enter all the details in the ‘User form’ like, First Name, Last Name, Age, Address, Phone etc.

Once you enter all this information, you need to click on the ‘SAVE’ button in order to save the user. Now you can see a success message saying, “New User has been created 
successfully”.
    But when you entered into your application by logging in and navigated to USERS menu > New user, entered all the required information to create the new user and clicked on 
    SAVE button.

BANG! The application crashed and you got one error page on the screen. (Capture this error message window and save as a Microsoft paint file)

Now, this is the bug scenario and you would like to report this as a BUG in your bug-tracking tool.
    
Please use GitLab issues to track public bugs.Please Follow the following instructions while reporting a bug.

    * A quick summary and/or background
    * Steps to reproduce the bug
    * Give sample code for necessary
    * Reasonable expected code
    * Notes

# Request for enhancement and template
    The Enhancement Request is the "kick-­‐off" document which describes an enhancement to an existing system that requires a structured project management approach, but perhaps	
not as much as a full-­‐ blown project.	The Enhancement Request should provide the high-­‐level overview of the effort to define the specific scope: describe the purpose of the	
effort, what will and will not be delivered, what resources are required, when the effort will be completed, as well as a high-­‐level communication plan.
