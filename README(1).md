#  RAINFALL ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION  #

# Introduction to the project:


A rainfall monitoring system based on daily rainfall estimates from the Climate Prediction Center,The interface allows users to analyze recent rainfall in the Telangana.
Rural farmers rely on rain-fed agriculture for food and income, yet they experience high rainfall variability ranging from extreme drought to flooding rainfall fromtropical cyclone systems.
To explore linkages between rainfall and agriculture, the authors regress changes in annual household per capita agricultural income on reliance on staple
food crops, agricultural and demographic characteristics, and rainfall patterns using longitudinal data for rural households
for year 2018-2019.
They characterize rainfall patterns by defining alldistricts in telanagana  using the percent of cumulative rainfall,maximum humidity and minimum humidity, received in each month of three agricultural growing seasons and rainfall from two tropical cyclones that occurred during the study period.
Results show that in a period where monthly rainfall seldom occurred in normal amounts, most households experienced decreases in agricultural income.
Even after controlling for rainfall patterns, they find that greater household dependency on staple crop agriculture is associated with declining annual agricultural income.
They also find that areas affected by both wet and dry rainfall extremes in the first year of the study had decreases in the well-being of rural households when measured two years later.
Taken together, their findings suggest that antipoverty policies focused on increasing agricultural income seem likely to fail in countries characterized by highly variable rainfall and exposure to extreme events, particularly when coupled with high levels of poverty and widespread dependence on rain-fed agriculture.

# Purpose to the project:

An important aspect to be understood regarding the relationship between rainfall 
and agriculture is that rainfall is the major factor in the growth and production of food crops both at the 
germination and fruit development stage. But with a change in the world’s climate, temperatures will rise and 
rainfall will increase in some places. In other places, rainfall will decrease. Other than the effect of high and low rainfall 
on cropping patterns, it is predicted that phenomena such as coastal flooding will reduce the amount of land available for 
agriculture. Farmers are already finding it difficult to cope with these environmental changes, as almost all crops are 
season-dependent and rainfall-dependent. Temperature and rainfall changes induced by climate change are likely to further react
with other parameters of plant growth like atmospheric gases, fertilizers, insects, plant pathogens, weeds, and the 
soil’s organic matter. This again is expected to produce unanticipated responses.
Due to uncertanity in the rainfall since last two years,farmers face many problems.
As we know Rainfall plays vital role in agriculture.
Taking this into consideration as a problem,we collected previous years datasets of telangana rainfall and performed basic visualisations and analysis and predict average cumm rainfall in future
